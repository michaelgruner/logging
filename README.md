# Logging++

> A c++ port of the Python Logging facility

This project is meant to be as a literal port as possible of the great
[Logging facility for
Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#). Users should
be able to refer to that documentation and easily extrapolate the
concepts to this codebase.

Stay tuned for updates!
